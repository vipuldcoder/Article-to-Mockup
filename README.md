# Article-to-Mockup
Practice HTML syntax by converting a mockup of a blog article into a real website!

1) Text Formatting: All text is formatted identically to the mockup. You should not use break tags for this project. You can create the desired separation with paragraph tags (text).

2) Image and Link: The imageâ€™s source is the correct URL and all links in the article are correct.

#Project Submission

A) Take a moment to double check that your index.html file renders exactly like the mockup! You do not have to match the margins (spacing along the sides) of the mockup.

B) Make sure you've answered all the questions for the reflection. Feel free to use your native language! Graders will translate if necessary.

C) Create and submit a zip file containing index.html and reflections.txt.
